DjangoLastFMAuth is a basic implementation of a Django project incorporating an application handling authentication with Last.FM.

It includes a simple API wrapper for making queries to the Last.FM web services, handling simple unauthed calls and calls that require authentication and signing.

To try it out just add your Last.FM API key to 'views.py' and run the server. You can login with last.fm, which will create a local user with user information returned from the 'user.getinfo' last.fm web service. This user is automatically logged in to the site.
